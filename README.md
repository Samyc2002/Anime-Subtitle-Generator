# Anime Subtitle Generator

This repository contains an illegal weapon for all the weebs out there.
Yes, you heard it right. It generates subtitles for any video file that you provide. Currently, it can convert only 500 words a month (lol).
So if you want to use it, clone the repo, set it up, buy a google translate API key and run it to get the anime subbed to any language you want.
