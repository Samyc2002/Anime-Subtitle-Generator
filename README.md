# Anime Subtitle Generator

This repository contains an illegal weapon for all the weebs out there.
Yes, you heard it right. It generates subtitles for any video file that you
provide. Currently, it can convert only 500 words a month (lol).
So if you want to use it, clone the repo, set it up, buy a google translate API
key and run it to get the anime subbed to any language you want.

## Uses

- This can be used to get transcriptions from a video file.
  The transcriptions can be generated for any language. However, only a few video
  languages are supported as of now. To know the details, check out `https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/#supported-languages`

## Limitations

- This project uses assembly AI APIs for speech to text and
  google translation API for text translations. So, API keys for these are required.

- The limitations are the same as the ones mentioned in the corresponding API key
  docs.

## How to use the project

We haven't made a production release yet (because of the limitations).
Hence, it is yet a proof of concept.
So, to use the project, you need to do the following:

- Clone the Repo.
- Get an Assembly AI API key
- Get a google translate API key from Rapid API
- Run the app locally.

This is totally open sourced and you can host it yourself if you wish to.

To run the app locally, you can either use the server only or
use both the client and the server.
Please check out the corresponding docs for details.
